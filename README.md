# Here comes the `desktoppr`!

I wrote a simple command line tool which can read and set the desktop picture. [Neil Martin had the brilliant idea](https://macadmins.slack.com/archives/C19MR7EM9/p1536586211000100) to call it `desktoppr`.

You can read the current desktop picture with:

```
$ desktoppr
/Library/Desktop Pictures/Sierra.jpg
```

and set the desktop picture with

```
$ desktoppr "/Library/Desktop Pictures/BoringBlueDesktop.png"
```

When you have multiple displays, `desktoppr` will list all desktop pictures:

```
$ desktoppr
/Library/Desktop Pictures/HotStepper.jpg
/Library/Desktop Pictures/LyricalGangster.jpg
/Library/Desktop Pictures/MrOfficer.jpg
```

When you pass a file `desktoppr` will set it as the desktop picture for _all_ screens:

```
$ desktoppr /Library/Desktop Pictures/NaahNananah.jpg
$ desktoppr
/Library/Desktop Pictures/NaahNananah.jpg
/Library/Desktop Pictures/NaahNananah.jpg
/Library/Desktop Pictures/NaahNananah.jpg
```

You can also set the desktop for a specific screen: (index starts at zero)

```
$ desktoppr 0 /Library/Desktop Pictures/HotStepper.jpg
$ desktoppr 1 /Library/Desktop Pictures/LyricalGangster.jpg
$ desktoppr 2 /Library/Desktop Pictures/MrOfficer.jpg
```

You can get the code for `desktoppr` on my Github page and an installer [here](https://github.com/scriptingosx/desktoppr/releases). The installer pkg will install the tool in `/usr/local/bin`. When you want to run it from a management script it is safest to include the entire path:

```
/usr/local/bin/desktoppr "/Library/Desktop Pictures/BoringBlueDesktop.png"
```

Since the `desktoppr` tool also sets user preferences, you still need to pay attention that it runs as the user. A LaunchAgent or a solution like [`outset`](https://github.com/chilcote/outset) is a good choice to manage this.

The tool requires the [Swift 5 Runtime support for command line tools](https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1998) when you install it on versions of macOS older than 10.14.4.
